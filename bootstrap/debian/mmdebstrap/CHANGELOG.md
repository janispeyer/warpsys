------------------

 - enforce dpkg >= 1.20.0 and apt >= 2.3.7

0.8.0 (2021-09-21)
------------------

 - allow running inside chroot in root mode
 - allow running without /dev, /sys or /proc
 - new --format=null which gets automatically selected if the output is

0.7.2 (2020-11-28)
------------------

 - check whether tools like dpkg and apt are installed at startup
 - make it possible to seed /var/cache/apt/archives with deb packages
 - if a suite name was specified, use the matching apt index to figure out the
   package set to install
 - use Debian::DistroInfo or /usr/share/distro-info/debian.csv (if available)
   to figure out the security mirror for bullseye and beyond
 - use argparse in tarfilter and taridshift for proper --help output

0.7.1 (2020-09-18)
------------------

 - bugfix release

0.7.0 (2020-08-27)
-----------------

 - the hook system (setup, extract, essential, customize and hook-dir) is made
   public and is now a documented interface
 - tarball is also created if the output is a named pipe or character special
 - add --format option to control the output format independent of the output
   filename or in cases where output is directed to stdout
 - generate ext2 filesystems if output file ends with .ext2 or --format=ext2

   chroot anymore for modes other than fakechroot and proot
 - add ready-to-use hook scripts for eatmydata, merged-usr and busybox
 - add tarfilter tool
 - use distro-info-data and debootstrap to help with suite name and keyring
   discovery
 - no longer needs to install twice when --depkgopt=path-exclude is given
 - variant=custom and hooks can be used as a debootstrap wrapper
 - use File::Find instead of "du" to avoid different results on different
   filesystems

0.6.1 (2020-03-08)
------------------

 - fix deterministic tar with pax and xattr support

0.6.0 (2020-01-16)
------------------

 - allow multiple --architecture options
 - allow multiple --include options
 - enable parallel compression with xz by default
 - add --man option
 - add --keyring option overwriting apt's default keyring

0.5.1 (2019-10-19)
------------------

 - minor bugfixes and documentation clarification
 - the --components option now takes component names as a comma or whitespace
   separated list or as multiple --components options
 - make_mirror.sh now has to be invoked manually before calling coverage.sh

0.5.0 (2019-10-05)
------------------

 - do not unconditionally read sources.list stdin anymore
     * if mmdebstrap is used via ssh without a pseudo-terminal, it will stall
       forever
     * as this is unexpected, one now has to explicitly request reading
       sources.list from stdin in situations where it's ambiguous whether
       that is requested
     * thus, the following modes of operation don't work anymore:
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir < sources.list
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir http://mirror < sources.list
     * instead, one now has to write:
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir - < sources.list
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir http://mirror - < sources.list
 - fix binfmt_misc support on docker

   be used without it
 - do not copy /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hostname if the host system doesn't
   have them

 - create /var/lib/dpkg/cmethopt for dselect
 - do not skip package installation in 'custom' variant
 - fix EDSP output for external solvers so that apt doesn't mark itself as
   Essential:yes
 - also re-exec under fakechroot if fakechroot is picked in 'auto' mode
 - chdir() before 'apt-get update' to accomodate for apt << 1.5
 - add Dir::State::Status to apt config for apt << 1.3
 - chmod 0755 on qemu-user-static binary
 - select the right mirror for ubuntu, kali and tanglu

   bars

   debootstrap wrappers like sbuild-createchroot

   to stderr
